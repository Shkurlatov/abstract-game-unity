# Abstract Game Prototype

![Header](docs/media/project_demo.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains the prototype of an abstract game developed using Unity 2021.3.25f1. The project demonstrates core game development skills and adherence to the specific requirements of the test assignment.

The project has certain features and constraints due to the specific requirements and limitations of the test assignment it was created for. One requirement was to use a non-descriptive project name and omit detailed descriptions of the genre and core mechanics in the documentation, to prevent direct copying among participants during the selection process. Additionally, the task emphasized minimizing the use of third-party packages and plugins, encouraging the development of custom logic. The project was also to be completed within a strictly defined timeframe.

Therefore, this implementation is not intended to showcase best practices for building a production-level application. Instead, it serves as a demonstration of the ability to rapidly prototype a new genre under specified constraints.

## Features

- **Smooth Animations:** High-quality animations for game elements.
- **Dynamic Game Board:** Flexible setup for various game board configurations.
- **Save/Load System:** Persistent game progress across sessions.
- **Scoring Mechanism:** A system to track and display player performance.
